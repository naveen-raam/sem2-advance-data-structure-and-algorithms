# sem2-advance-data-structure-and-algorithms
This is shortest path algorithm from one node to another with extra thing that path from node to node may have block and it will find after reaching that path.
On this case, this algorithm will find another path and traverse through that.
This will work in O(n*(V+Elog*V)) n-No. of blocks, V-No. of vertices, E-no of edges.

This is the graph through which it has been traversing
