# sem2-advance-data-structure-and-algorithms
This is shortest path algorithm from one node to another with extra thing that path from node to node may have block and it will find after reaching that path. On this case, this algorithm will find another path and traverse through that.thia will work in O(n*(V+Elog*V)) n-No. of blocks, V-No. of vertices, E-no of edges
